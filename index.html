      <h3> About Re-Entry Navigation Service</h3>
      <p>
      If you or someone you know is returning to New York City after release from
      the New York State prison system (NYS Department of Corrections and
       Community Supervision, or DOCCS),
      assistance in establishing yourself for a crime-free and successful
      re-entry is necessary. Priority is given to individuals referred to RNS from
      the <a href="https://paroleprepny.org/">The Parole Preparation Project.

    <p>After surviving a state prison sentence, an incercerated person is released to society on parole supervision.
      A returning citizen has to create a new life in the real world from scratch. In the process, returning citizens frequently discover
      that supposedly concerned and empathetic people and agencies who provided "reasonable assurance letters"
      to the Parole Board on their behalf are more concerned about self-enrichment (getting themselves paid),
      using returning citizens as a pretext to get grants and donations.
