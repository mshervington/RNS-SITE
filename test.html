  <p>I provide re-entry navigaton services to individuals returning to New York City upon release from the NY State Department of Corrections and
    Community Supervision (DOCCS). Priority is given to referrals from the <a href="https://paroleprepny.org/">The Parole Preparation Project.</a>
  </p>

    <p>After surviving a state prison sentence, an incercerated person is released to society on parole supervision.
      A returning citizen has to create a new life in the real world from scratch. In the process, returning citizens frequently discover
      that supposedly concerned and empathetic people and agencies who provided "reasonable assurance letters"
      to the Parole Board on their behalf are more concerned about self-enrichment (getting themselves paid),
      using returning citizens as a pretext to get grants and donations.
