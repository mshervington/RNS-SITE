<p>Real-world life is not like a hip-hop video. Upon release, a returning citizen should focus
  their time and energy on:</p>
<ul>
  <div>
  <a href="#health">Health Care</a>
  <a href="#housing">Stable Housing</a>
  <a href="#employment">Employment</a>
  <a href="#money">Handling Money</a>
  <a href="#release">Release Conditions</a>
  </div
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
  <h3 id="health">Health Care</h3>
  <img src="images/healthcare.jpg" width="200px">
  <p>Incarcerated citizens receive sub-standard medical care. Sometimes they are released with unknown
    medical issues that could prove fatal if not properly diagnosed and treated.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <h3 id="housing">Stable Housing</h3><img src="images/housing.jpg" width="200px">
  <p>A safe, clean and stable place to live after release is one of the most critical needs
    for a returning citizen.</p>
  </li>
<li>
  <h3 id="employment">Employment</H3><img src="images/construction-worker.jpg" width="200px">
  <p>Being able to provide for one's own needs empowers a returning citizen to become and remain
    self-sufficient. Finding and maintaining steady legal employment is a must.</p>
  </li>
<li>
  <h3 id="money">Handling Money</H3><img src="images/finances.jpg" width="200px">
  <p>"Gate money" won't last forever in the real world. To maintain yourself you must be wise
    about handling your money.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="release">Release Conditions</H3><img src="images/contract.jpg" width="200px">
      <p>To remain free and able to function on your own, following the conditions of your
        parole release is most important.</p>
